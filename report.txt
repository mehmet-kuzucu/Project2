
First, a screen was provided to enter the names of the users, then the password was created and after the password control was ensured, Using the if and strcmp functions, users were able to create an existing username and a compatible password. Again with the same functions, in case of password incompatibility, a warning stating that the password was incorrect was displayed. The users were directed to the menu and asked to press a key according to the operation they wanted to do. Users who wanted to vote were asked to press 1 and users who pressed 1 encountered the voting screen. We asked do you want to die. We used struct to allow different variables to be accessed. And then we asked do you want to go to the library? Again, with struct function. Then we were required to get answers from users as yes, no, or abstain In order not to vote again after voting, a text called "You have already voted" has been removed by using the function to avoid voting again. the number of votes was counted, and the program was terminated or continued if the majority of votes was achieved. After voting, the options were displayed again, and the admin is asked if they want to add a new user if yes they press 99 the new user is then asked what he wanted to do. We said that if you want to change a vote, press 4; for changing a password, press 3; for adding a new problem, press 5; for leaving the system, press 0; All of the processes were red and written to file.
